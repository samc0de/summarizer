these have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips . always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks . top quality ingredients ; brown rice , oat fiber , sunflower seeds etc . are what give this product the taste to start a conversation . serve with fresh veggies and a good dip , always a crowd pleas - er ! i certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor .

these have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips . always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks . top quality ingredients ; brown rice , oat fiber , sunflower seeds etc . are what give this product the taste to start a conversation . serve with fresh veggies and a good dip , always a crowd pleas - er ! i certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor .

these have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips . always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks . top quality ingredients ; brown rice , oat fiber , sunflower seeds etc . are what give this product the taste to start a conversation . serve with fresh veggies and a good dip , always a crowd pleas - er ! i certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor .

these have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips . always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks . top quality ingredients ; brown rice , oat fiber , sunflower seeds etc . are what give this product the taste to start a conversation . serve with fresh veggies and a good dip , always a crowd pleas - er ! i certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor .

these have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips . always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks . top quality ingredients ; brown rice , oat fiber , sunflower seeds etc . are what give this product the taste to start a conversation . serve with fresh veggies and a good dip , always a crowd pleas - er ! i certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor .

these have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips . always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks . top quality ingredients ; brown rice , oat fiber , sunflower seeds etc . are what give this product the taste to start a conversation . serve with fresh veggies and a good dip , always a crowd pleas - er ! i certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor .

these have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips . always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks . top quality ingredients ; brown rice , oat fiber , sunflower seeds etc . are what give this product the taste to start a conversation . serve with fresh veggies and a good dip , always a crowd pleas - er ! i certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor .
